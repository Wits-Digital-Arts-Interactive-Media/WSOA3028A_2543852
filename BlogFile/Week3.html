        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <p>
            The alignment of a website can outline the purpose of its design. This sense of direction can better help a website carry out the task that it was meant to do, whether it's selling a product, displaying work or made simply for browsing. All the choices that a designer makes are made with this "alignment" in mind, and they can either assist or obstruct the purpose of the website.
            On a more philosophical note, we all have our own "alignment". This alignment is better described as our <i>ideal self</i>, the person we want to become, someone you've been working towards. Similar to the realms of web design, we each make decisions that aid our journey of manifesting this <i>ideal self</i>. I will use a Cherokee fable as metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within each of us lives 2 wolves in constant battle.<br>
            One, kind and just.<br>
            The other, cruel and malevolent.<br> 
            The wolf that wins, is the wolf you choose to feed.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each decision you make can either assist or obstruct the journey of becoming your <i>ideal self</i>. So, choose carefully!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Web Alignment</h2>
        <p>
            The goal for this website is for future employers, or people of interest, to scout my portfolio and get a grasp of who I am, what my skills are, and past projects I've worked on. Users should be able to browse through the contents of this website and gain insight into the level of work I am able to produce. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My target audience are employers (within the programing or gaming industry), that want more insight or tangible proof that I am a suitable candidate for the open position. The attraction points for such an audience would be past projects that display my current skillset, and I'm assuming that they would also like to play/use the things I've developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, I will display the information of my website in a manner that highlights the work that I produce and makes it easily accessible to see my latest projects. The user experience will also leave a lasting impression on the level of work I am able to produce. In order to align this experience with the purpose of the website, I will ensure that users are greeted with a professional yet personal setting. I will follow the UI and UX trends that companies such as Riot Games, Unity, and Unreal Engine seem to fall under. This will, hopefully, make a bold statement to the user and clearly state my intentions.
        </p>

        <h2>Semantic Markup</h2>
        <p>
            After learning about semantic markup this week, I decided to implement this newfound standard into my website. <br>
            These changes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                changing all div-elements into article and section-elements
            </li>
            <li>
                adding alt-attributes to all my images
            </li>
            <li>
                Reordering my h1-h6 elements to form a user-friendly hierarchy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding a nav-element for navigational links 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With the addition of these features, more people will be able engage with my website without difficulty or exclusion.
