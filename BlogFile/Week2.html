        <h2>URL scheme</h2>
        <br>
        <article>
            With regards to the URL scheme, I would like to make my portfolio website a secure site. In order to make it a secure website, I will have to follow a protocol that will allow me to obtain and install an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). To be very honest... on a surface-level it seems do-able but taking a second glance at it makes it look like more and more of a hassle. In order to get an SSL you have to register your website by generating a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) on your server. I'm not too sure if I can make my school laptop a functioning server to host my website... but it doesn't seem like a good idea. But that is only one of the many issues and decisions I will have to make with regards to obtaining an SSL (at the moment I am severely underqualified and ignorant). So, for the time being I will just have to stick with keeping it as an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) instead of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). edit: I just realized GitHub does all the admin for you! THANK YOU GITHUB!

        <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
        <br>
        <article>
            The folder structure of your website can vary depending on what purpose the website was made to serve, as well as personal preference. We were warned that throughout the course of creating out websites, we will go through multiple iterations until a suitable one finally emerges. As of now, my folder structure is as follows:
        </article>
        <ul>
            <li>
                BlogFile (folder)
                <ul>
                    <li>Store html files for the weekly blog posts, allowing for the structure to look neat as well as functionally accessible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Images
                <ul>
                   <li>Store all the images that the website will require.</li> 
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Portfolio
                <ul>
                    <li>Store all the html files that will have anything to do with my portfolio</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Scripts
                <ul>
                    <li>Store JavaScript code and allows for it to be neat and accessible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Style
                <ul>
                    <li>Store CSS code and allows for it to be neat and accessible. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                index.html (homepage)
                <ul>
                    <li>Will include a short bio about each page of the website and offer a link to direct the user to the page that manages the desired info. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <br>
        <article>My wireframes are inspired by the general design trend that seems to appear within the websites mentioned above. The smooth, simplistic and satisfying UI makes these websites professional and creative. They display colourful and impressive videos and screenshots of what their product is able to achieve. I would like to approach my portfolio website in a similar fashion where I show my work in the background and what I am capable of, after all its what a portfolio website is all about! </article>

        <h2>Interaction & www</h2>
        <br>
        <article>
            Interaction, to my understanding, is the quality of "something" that is <ins>responsive</ins> in a <ins>predictable manner</ins> and the effort required to interact with "something" is <ins>not obvious</ins>, but it possesses the ability to <ins>change</ins> the "something".  Interaction within the context of the internet can determine whether or not the user experience is satisfying or not. In the video
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7CpRH2WbME&t=6s">Normal Doors & Human-Centered Design</a>
            , it explains a concept called the "Norman door". A Norman door is a door where the design tells a person to do the opposite of what the person should actually do. In the video it is represented by this door that EVERYONE in the building hates, because it has a pull handle on the push-side of the door. This deceives the person interacting with the door into thinking they are on the pull-side of the door, leading them to make the mistake of yanking instead of pushing (very frustrating indeed!) 
        </article>
        <article>
            When making UI, DO NOT make Norman Door-like UI. This frustration will lead to a kak (excuse the French) user experience. Make sure that the UI looks like what it is meant to do. The experience of interacting with good UI must feel seamless. Things simply do what you expect them to do.

        <h2>'You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)' - Moulthrop, S.</h2>
        <br>
        <article>
            Xanadu, a globally accessible library of information monitored by a link-and-retrieve system, is a concept introduced by Theodor Holm Nelson said to revolutionize the world! Similar to how Vannevar Bush conceptualized the MEMEX and how it described the modern-day computer. Nelson was describing what is now known as the World Wide Web. Nelson dives into the intricacies of what this technology may offer society and in turn what may result of humanity because of this technology. He describes in a freakishly familiar yet dated manner of what is to come of a society if information were to become readily available and expandable. Moulthrop uses McLuhan's 4 questions from 'Laws of Media' (1991) as a framework to understand the potential within hypertext. These questions are:
        </article>
        <ol>
            <li>What does hypertext enhance or intensify?</li>
            <li>What does hypertext render obsolete or displace?</li>
            <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolete?</li>
            <li>What does it produce or become when taken to its limits?</li>
        </ol>
        <article>Moulthrop describes hypertext as not fundamentally new, it is but a recursion or extension of print. The new added feature being: users having the ability to construct discourse instead of just being a consumer of one. Back in the day only qualified people were able to publish written work (on paper) and hence there was an information hierarchy. Only the qualified were allowed to produce information, the "un-qualified" were only allowed to be humble consumers. Hypertext smashes this hierarchy by allowing all users to produce work. Moulthrop suggests that users will become "paranoids" as a result of this. Since users will uphold their discourse with a sense of authority and tracing that authority will end up being quite difficult. </article>
        <article>The obvious answer might be books, but you will be gravely mistaken. Moulthrop instead points out that what hypertext will render obsolete is post-literacy. Hypertext will ensure the continuation of human knowledge and wisdom and act as an endless library of information. </article>
        <article>Xanadu offers the opportunity for the re-awakening of primary literacy as a mass phenomenon, and in turn also gives hand to the continuation of secondary literacy. This comes as a result of offering users the cyberspace required to shape interactive discourse. </article>
        <article>When hypertext is taken to its limit, it hands the control of cultural work to the audience of the world. There will be a big change with regards to the power game, since everyone has the ability to access and expand upon information. Social views may be openly disclosed, and information becomes a form of capital. The more you have the more power you possess. </article>
        <article>Although the concept Xanadu was conceived before the www, it was a bit late to the party... (only releasing in 2014). But the social, political and literary influence of the www can be clearly seen today. Nelson's predictions to what society will come to has become quite familiar in today's setting and may even further predict what the future has in stall!</article>
