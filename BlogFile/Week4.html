        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>IxD Process</h2>
        <p>
            This process will guide me throughout the rest of my website's development. Certain elements may change over time, but design is an iterative process so its ok! This process includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Goal Alignment</li>
            <li>Information Structure</li>
            <li>User Flow</li>
            <li>Interface</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Implementation</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
        <p>
            My goal for this website is to show future employers and people of interest the skills I am capable of and to give them a brief introduction to who I am. I want users to see:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>my unity projects and builds</li>
            <li>coding projects (including this website)</li>
            <li>my profile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            users should be able to freely explore the portfolio website and get a good idea of who I am and what I do. Users would want to see:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a display of my skills (game design, programing)</li>
            <li>get a brief introduction... to me? of me? (English was a struggle here)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Information Structure</h2>

        <img src="../Image/2.png" title="Folder Structure" alt="Folder structure fo my website" width="400">
        <br>
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <img src="../Image/User Flow Diagram.drawio.png" width="400" title="User Flow Diagram 1.0" alt="User Flow Diagram 1.0">
        <p>
            I will create a semiotic system that looks and feels predictable. This will allow for better user experience and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will keep in mind the 3-click rule; users should be able to get to wherever they'd like in 3 clicks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Interface Elements</h2>
        <p>
            I will ensure that the Navigational and Informational components are implemented clearly and represented in a user-friendly approach. 
        </p>

        <h2>Design Principles</h2>
        <p>
            In order to design successful and user-friendly UX and UI, I will implement the core principles of UX and UI. These elements will also give the user a first glance idea of who I am and what I find important.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            I haven't started learning JavaScript and CSS, so the website just contains the folder structure and semantic markup I've managed to implement on HTML. I just need to make sure that any in-line code is taken care of before I start adding CSS and JavaScript into the website to prevent future disaster. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Website Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Its currently the 4th week since the birth of this website, and I must say I've really enjoyed the learning process. I enjoyed learning HTML. The process of building a website and being able to traverse through this public virtual page that I have created is a new experience that is very different from putting my games on itch. So far, I am happy with the file layout of the website. I feel comfortable writing code that draws information from different files because of the intuitive system I've created for myself to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, the website just looks a bit "nude", so I am looking forward to learning CSS so it can look a more clothed and appropriate... I am also looking forward to learning JavaScript, since that opens the doors to creating web-art similar to particle life and boids algorithms that I want to give a shot.
