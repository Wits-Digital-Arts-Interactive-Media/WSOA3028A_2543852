        <h3>Week 1</h3>
        <hr>
        <b>A New Philosophy (Purpose > Motivation)</b>
        <br><br>
        As the first week of university draws to a close, I can't help but feel a bit excited and overwhelmed about the new skills I will acquire in the year to come. Throughout the break, I have had time to re-evaluate my approach to learning and in turn tackle my academics this year from a fresh perspective. My approach to university last year was very mark-centric and tended to fall prey to favoritism, not the healthiest learning mindset, and hence everything felt like a blur with a few concepts that seem to have stuck around and the others lost in the void of my brain. Very noticeably I enjoyed the game dev/coding side of the course and tended to give SUPREME effort into that end, and as a result have not made the most of my available resources. My approach this year will try and even out the playing field and allow me to give equal attention to each of my modules. This will have to come with great discipline and hence I have adopted the "Purpose > Motivation" philosophy.
        <br><br>
        Motivation is great, we love that feeling we have of wanting to get started on something especially at the beginning of the year: 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>motivation to study more.</li>
            <li>motivation to start exercising every day.</li>
            <li>motivation to start eating healthier.</li>
            <li>...</li>

        </ul>
        But one drawback is that motivation is a feeling. Feelings come and go very easily and are hard to control if you don't practice. That is why motivation can come just as easy as it goes. Purpose on the other hand is a more solid structure. We do things with a purpose/reason behind it. 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>eating to replenish my body's fuel source.</li>
            <li>sleeping to recharge</li>
            <li>working to make money.</li>
            <li>studying to be able to get into work.</li> 
        </ul>
        These can all differ from person to person, but the general idea is that we do A to achieve B. A purpose gives meaning to the action because there is an end in mind. This philosophy will serve as a baseline for my approach of being a student not only in the realm of university but as a student for what life has to offer.

        <b>As We May Think - Vannevar Bush 1945</b>
        <br><br>
        Reading has played a big factor in this new approach; I've only recently started reading around March 2023. Especially throughout this holiday I've grown to thoroughly enjoy it. One thing I didn't enjoy as much last year was academic reading...  it felt long repetitive and tedious. With the new mindset in place, tackling this week's reading wasn't all too bad, I might even go as far as to say I enjoyed it! 
        <br><br>
        In short, As We May Think was Bush's conception of what the modern-day computer might be. He called it the MEMEX. A device that can call on files from a large library and splice together different information in order to streamline the research pipeline. We must bear in mind that back in the day (1945) the internet didn't exist. Information was a hassle to get a hold of (in today's terms). Different mediums called for different storage devices. These devices took up physical space (not digital) that you had to sort and share. 1945 marked the end of World War 2, as well as a boom in the realm of science. Scientist from vastly different fields realized that their research could prove helpful in the most unexpected cases. Different fields of study borrowing from other fields of study was great! but it was also difficult knowing where to look for the right information, contacting the right people, the process of delivering that information... you get the idea. The MEMEX was Bush's vision of breaking that barrier. If information could be easily transported, the creation and production of research will greatly improve leading to an information boom that would've been groundbreaking at the time. Similar to how the first printing presses allowed for the transfer of information through text, the creation of the MEMEX will transform society with its exposure to this new availability of information. A good chunk of the reading is spent on the progress man has made to store different types of information, visual, textual and auditory and the extents at which we have iteratively improved the systems we use to store them. 
        <br><br>
        What blew my mind away was finding out the Bush was a part of the Manhattan project. For those of your who might not know, it was a project dedicated to the creation of nuclear weaponry. It was quite fascinating to me how a scientist behind the research of pure destructive power was able to describe what is known as a modern computer today.

        <b>Git & GitHub</b>
        <br><br>
        Since I have experience with GitHub as a version control software, Git wasn't too much to handle. Git just felt like GitHub with a few different steps. What I found pretty cool was that the version control was within the Visual Studio Code editor, this makes it a lot less tedious to manage version control. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Cool stuff on the internet</b>
        <br><br>
        This is a pretty website that demonstrates particle life simulation. Each colored particle is given an attraction/repulsion value to other colored particles. You are able to alter these rules and watch as the magic happens before your eyes. It's crazy how with these simple rules a computer is able to create such a beautiful phenomenon. I'd suggest that you give it a try yourself.
