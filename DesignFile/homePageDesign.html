            <p>
                The idea of the design comes from a trend I came across with big gaming company websites (bellow will be links to each of these companies). My idea is that if this trend appears in all these big name companies, I can leverage off this trend to let this portfolio's intended auduence to know that I am intersted in thier field. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What I found very appealing in this design is the simlicity that it holds. Each deisgn element that is incorperated carries the message that the company wants to get through. Interaction with the website speaks to the user in a way that foreshadoes the users experience with thier product, which I find awesome.

            <p>
                I maintained the initial idea of making the home page look professional by imitating the trends seen on company websites such as Riot Games and Unity. The Nav-bar seen on top of the wireframes will continue throughout the rest of the pages. This will make it a reliable interface that users can use to navigate through my portfolio. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each section will also be interactable, and clicking in the general area will send the user to the page. There will be an image or video playing in the background that covers the interactable area, this will indicate the range that the userâ€™s cursor must hover over in order to interact with the element.

            <img src="../Image/bentoBoxWebsite1.png" width="400" alt="bento UI trend example" title="bento UI trend example">
            <p>
                I was heavily inspired by the bento UI trend commonly seen in a few professional website and apps.
                This design trend is inspired by the Japanese lunch box, also known as a bento box.
                The bento UI makes the website look clean and modest and my home page can now fit on a single screen without the user having to scroll!
                there are exeptions to this like <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">Apples App Store</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a> where the disgn both incorperates scrolling and bento UI. 
                This makes the interface look eligant and beautiful.
