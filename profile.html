            Hey! I'm Jay and I am currently a 3rd year student studying BA Digital Arts at WITS.
            <br>
            Above is a very high res portrait of myself, appreciate it in all its glory.
            <br>
            I enjoy making games and programming! My life has been a flux of creativity and logic and it has eventually lead me down the path of persuing work within the game design and programming fields.
