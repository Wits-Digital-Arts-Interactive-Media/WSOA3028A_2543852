        Hey! I'm Jay and I am currently a 3rd year student studying BA Digital Arts at WITS.
        <br>
        Above is a very high res portrait of myself, appreciate it in all its glory.
        <br>
        I enjoy making games and programming! My life has been a flux of creativity and logic and it has eventually lead me down the path of persuing work within the game design and programming fields.
